# Review Analysis Programming Project
A small project I was asked to complete for a frontend developer job interview at a San Francisco tech startup. Programming skills evaluated were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was asked to provide my working code sample in a single plain text attachment to an email, which is why all code is inside one HTML file. The time I had to complete this project was 48 hours.

# Task Description
"Your task is to build a web page using HTML/CSS/JavaScript that analyzes a single [mobile app] review, by allowing the user to input an arbitrary string of up to 5000 characters, and which will then analyze the text to calculate the frequency of every unique ‘word’ (part 1) or 2-word phrase (part 2) in the given text.

The definition of a ‘word’ is up to you, but please be explicit in your response (or code comments) on how you chose to define a ‘word’.

After analysis, the counts for every unique word or 2-word phrase should be represented graphically within the web page in a format of your choice.

[...] [F]eel free to test with any text you feel would broaden the strength of your implementation, including real-world samples from your favorite Apps in the App Store.

Your solution should be implemented fully within the browser (no backend coding or deployment required). Be sure to focus equally on your user experience, UI design, and algorithmic analysis."
